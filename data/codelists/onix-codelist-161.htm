               ongoing hosting services for the resource for the active life of the product (or at least until the Until Date specified in
               &lt;ContentDate&gt;). The ONIX recipient may embed the URL in a consumer facing-website (eg as the src attribute in an &lt;img&gt; link),
               and need not host an independent copy of the resource.

               Until Date, but only for the ONIX recipient&#8217;s direct use. The ONIX recipient should download a copy of the resource, and must
               host an independent copy of the resource if it is used on a consumer-facing website. Special attention should be paid to the
               &#8216;Last Updated&#8217; &lt;ContentDate&gt; to ensure the independent copy of the resource is kept up to date.
