               be used when a product is cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be handled as a change
               of Publishing status, leaving the receiver to decide whether to retain or delete the record. A Delete instruction is only
               used when there is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued in error.
