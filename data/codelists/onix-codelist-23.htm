               that carry the main content of the book. Note that this may include numbered but otherwise blank pages (eg pages inserted
               to ensure chapters start on a recto page) and may exclude unnumbered (but contentful) pages such as those in inserts/plate
               sections. Either this or the Content Page count is the preferred page count for most books for the general reader. For books
               with substantial front and/or back matter, include also Front matter and Back matter page counts, or Total numbered pages.
               For books with inserts (plate sections), also include Total unnumbered insert page count whenever possible.
