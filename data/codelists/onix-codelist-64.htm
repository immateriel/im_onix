               this code for &#8216;reprint under consideration&#8217;. Code 06 does not specifically imply that returns are or are not still accepted.

               the same ISBN. Code 07 normally implies that the publisher will not accept returns beyond a specified date.

               for it, though stock may still be available elsewhere in the supply chain. Code 08 covers both of codes 06 and 07, and may
               be used where the distinction between those values is either unnecessary or meaningless.

            <td>The product is no longer available from the current publisher, under the current ISBN, at the current price. It may be available
               to be traded through another channel. A Publishing Status code 10 &#8216;Remaindered&#8217; usually but not always means that the publisher
               has decided to sell off excess inventory of the book. Copies of books that are remaindered are often made available in the
               supply chain at a reduced price. However, such remainders are often sold under a product identifier that differs from the
               ISBN on the full-priced copy of the book. A Publishing Status code 10 &#8216;Remaindered&#8217; on a given product record may or may not
               be followed by a Publishing Status code 06 &#8216;Out of Stock Indefinitely&#8217; or 07 &#8216;Out of Print&#8217;: the practise varies from one
               publisher to another. Some publishers may revert to a Publishing Status code 04 &#8220;Active&#8221; if a desired inventory level on the
               product in question has subsequently been reached. No change in rights should ever be inferred from this (or any other) Publishing
               Status code value.
